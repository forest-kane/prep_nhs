Repository housing data, code, and outputs from the study "Examining Geographic Variation in Self-Reported Household Preparedness in the United States and Puerto Rico"
This project used FEMA survey data from the National Household Survey (NHS) years 2017 - 2020 to develop estimates of household participation in different disaster
preparedness measures geographically on the state, county, and zip-code tabulation area (ZCTA) scales. Using a multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP)
approach, these data provide estimates of the percentage or proportion of households in a given geographic unit that participate in each action. 
We also develop and map an index of household disaster preparedness actions, providing an estimate of "overall preparedness" ranging from 0-1, low-to-high.
